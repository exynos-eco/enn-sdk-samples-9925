# Performance Comparison
This sample application provides a side-by-side analysis of the execution time differences between the ENN SDK and TFLite.

## Functionality
This application builds upon the Image Classification in Android sample application.    
In addition to executing the NNC model using the ENN framework, it runs the corresponding TFLite model.
The results and inference time of the ENN framework and TFLite are displayed at the bottom of the application interface.

## Getting Started
To utilize the sample application:
1.	Download or clone the sample application from this repository.
2.	Open the sample application project in Android Studio.
3.	Connect the ERD board to the computer.
4.	Run the application (using Shift + F10).
