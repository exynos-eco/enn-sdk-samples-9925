# Performance Comparison
The "Performance Comparison" sample application provides a side-by-side analysis of the execution time differences between the ENN SDK and TFLite.

## Functionality
This application builds upon the "Image Classification in Android" sample application.
In addition to executing the NNC model using the ENN Framework, it also runs the corresponding TFLite model. 
The results of the execution, along with the inference time for both the ENN Framework and TFLite, are displayed at the bottom of the application interface.
